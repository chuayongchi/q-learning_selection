## Overview
This project applies Q-learning, a type of reinforcement learning, to identify genetic markers associated with acne from gene expression datasets. The code processes gene expression data and trains a Q-learning model to select the most relevant genes.

## Installation
To run the code, first clone the repository and install the dependencies.
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genetic-markers-acne.git
cd genetic-markers-acne
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To execute the Q-learning model on one of the provided datasets, use the following command:
```
python qlearning_acne.py --dataset GSE108110
```
You can replace GSE108110 with other dataset identifiers like GSE53795 or GSE6475 as needed.
