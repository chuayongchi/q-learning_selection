# Q-learning for Selection of Genetic Markers Associated with Acne

This repository contains the code for a Q-learning model that selects genetic markers related to acne, based on gene expression data.

# Overview
This project applies Q-learning, a type of reinforcement learning, to identify genetic markers associated with acne from gene expression datasets. The code processes gene expression data and trains a Q-learning model to select the most relevant genes.
